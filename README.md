# Road-Maintenance
## Introduction to the Problem
According to [the Global Economy](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Kenya/roads_quality/), the road quality index (**RQI**) in Kenya in 2019 was 4.1, which put this country in 7th place right after South Africa (the comparison of these countries could be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/viktoriia8163/viz/Kenyaroadcondition/Dashboard3)). However, taking into account the fact that RQI varies from 1 to 7, the Kenya road condition can by no means be considered outstanding. Unfortunately, there is no open source recently updated data regarding current road conditions but, judging by the tendency of the last few years, the road quality was slowly declining. In view of this, the authorities should consider a reactive maintenance course of action.
