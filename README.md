# Road-Maintenance
## Introduction to the Problem
According to [the Global Economy](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Kenya/roads_quality/), the road quality index (**RQI**) in Kenya in 2019 was 4.1, which put this country in 7th place right after South Africa (the comparison of these countries could be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/viktoriia8163/viz/Kenyaroadcondition/Dashboard3)). However, taking into account the fact that **RQI varies from 1 to 7**, the Kenya road condition cannot be considered outstanding. Unfortunately, there is no open source recently updated data regarding current road conditions ([the latest update](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0042061) was in 2017) but, judging by the tendency of the last few years, the road quality was slowly declining. In view of this, the authorities should consider a reactive maintenance course of action. The designed **Kenya Roads** app will assist them in doing so. It provides detailed information on where the particularly problematic road sections are located and recommends specific works to improve the current situation.
